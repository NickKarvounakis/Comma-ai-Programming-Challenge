Below are trips from our dash cam users in the SF Bay Area,
each of which is a JSON file containing an array of coordinates and speed (m/s) sampled at once per second.
Build a performant web app containing an interactive map visualizing the distribution of speeds among these trips. 
All trips should be simultaneously visible on the map.
